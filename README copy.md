## Description

_{The purpose of this application is to showcase my understanding thus far of arrays and loops in Javascript, Utilitizing logic that converts numbers containing 1, 2, or 3, into Beep, Boop, or "Won't you be my neighbor?"}_

_This application can be broken down into distinct behaviors_

_Behavior 0 - A user inputs anything other than a number._
_Input: This is a number!_
_Suggested output: "That is not a number! Please enter a number!"_

_Behavior 1 - A user inputs a number containing 1, and all digitst are replaced with "Beep!"_
_Input: 1 or 15 or 41 or 71_
_Suggested output: Beep!_

_Behavior 2 - A user inputs a number containing 2, and all digitst are replaced with "Boop!"_
_Input: 2 or 25 or 42 or 72_
_Suggested output: Boop!_

_Behavior 3 - A user inputs a number containing 3, and all digitst are replaced with "Won't you be my neighbor?"_
_Input: 3 or 35 or 43 or 73_
_Suggested output: Won't you be my neighbor?_

_Behavior 4 - A user inputs a number lager than 3, and the program returns "Beep! Boop! Won't you be my neighbor?" followed by ever number leading up to and including the input_
